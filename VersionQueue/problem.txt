*Version Queue*

Design and implement a Version-Queue. A Version-Queue maintains a version
number along with normal Queue functionality. Every
operation[Enqueue/Dequeue] on the Queue increments its version.

Implement the following functions:

1. Enqueue - appends an element at the end of the queue.

2. Dequeue - returns the top element of the queue.

3. Print - it takes a version number as input and prints the elements of
the queue of the given version. The version number input can also be an
old/historical version number.

E.g. if the current version number of the queue is 7 and the input to this
function is 5, then it should print the elements of the queue when its
version number was 5.

For simplicity, assume the elements are integers.

We expect you to write a helper program to test the above data structure
which will read input from stdin and prints output to stdout.

Input format:
First line should have an integer n (number of operations). This should be
followed by n number of lines, each denoting one operation.
e.g.
6
e 1
e 4
d
e 5
p 2
p 4

'e' stands for enqueue
